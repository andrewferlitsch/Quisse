		<h4>What is Quisse for Kids?</h4>
		<p>
			Quisse is designed to help kids for early learning of math and groupings.
			Quisse consists of flashcards and multi-choice quizzes.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Selecting a Category</h4>
		<p>
			There are 5 learning categories to choose from. Use the 'Select Learning Category'
			drop down to select a category to quiz yourself on. At anytime, you can select other
			categories to quiz yourself on.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Flashcards</h4>
		<p>
		After you selected a category, you will be prompted with flashcards. Each flashcard will show
		a question. When you flip the flashcard (by clicking on it), it will show the answer. Use the
		Next buttons to advance to the next card. You can self-score yourself by selecing the Next button
		with the checkmark when you got the answer correct, or the Next button with the X when you did not
		answer the question correctly.
		</p>
		<p>
		The questions start at difficulty level 1, and will progressively advance to level 3. At each level,
		questions are selected at random. Once you've indicated you answered the question correctly, you will
		not see the question. The flashcards use an adaptive testing method to determine when to advance (or decrease)
		the difficulty level based on your self-scoring.
		</p>
		<p>
		Once the adaptive method determines you have passed, a You Passed will be displayed with a beep, and
		a button will appear to proceed to the Multiple Choice quiz section.

			<p>
			The algorithm evaluates questions in groups of four. If all four questions are answered correct, the algorithm
			will advance to the next level, unless you are already at level 3, then the algorithm will indicate you have passed.
			If two or more questions are answered incorrect, the algorithm will decrease a level, unless you are already at level
			1. Otherwise, the algorithm will stay on the same level. If all the questions at a level have been answered correctly,
			the algorithm will advance to the next level.

		<h4>Multiple Choice Quiz</h4>
		<p>
		Once you have completed the flashcard section, you can select the Start Quiz button to start the
		multiple choice quiz section. In this section, you will be presented with a question and four choices
		for answers, of which only one is correct. If you select the correct choice, a Correct will be displayed;
		otherwise a Not Correct will be displayed. Use the Next button to go to the next question.
		</p>
		<p>
		The questions start at difficulty level 1, and will progressively advance to level 3. At each level,
		questions are selected at random. Once you have answered a question correctly, you will not see it again.
		The multiple choice use an adaptive testing method to determine when to advance (or decrease)
		the difficulty level based on your scoring.
		</p>
		<p>
		The four choices consist of the correct answer and three wrong answers. 
		</p>
		<span style='color: orange; cursor: pointer' ng-click='showquizdetails=!showquizdetails'>&#9205; Algorithm Details</span>
		<div ng-show='showquizdetails' style='color: steelblue'>
			<p>
			The algorithm evaluates questions in groups of six. If all six questions are answered correct, the algorithm
			will advance to the next level, unless you are already at level 3, then the algorithm will indicate you have passed.
			If three or more questions are answered incorrect, the algorithm will decrease a level, unless you are already at level
			1. Otherwise, the algorithm will stay on the same level. If all the questions at a level have been answered correctly,
			the algorithm will advance to the next level.

		<h4>Scoring</h4>
		<p>
		In both the flashcard and multiple choice section, scoring is kept at the bottom of the page in
		the Score section.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Reset</h4>
		<p>
		At any time, you can restart the testing in a category with the Reset button in the Score section.
		This will reset the scoring and return you back to the beginning of the flashcards.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Last Note</h4>
		<p>
		We will be continually improving our adaptive testing techniques, timing analysis and NLP processing
		to provide you with the most effective learning experience possible - the Staff at Quizze.
