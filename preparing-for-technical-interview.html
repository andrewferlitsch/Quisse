<p>
In this type of technical interview, you will likely meet with several technical people. Each interviewer will pose one or more problems for you to solve. The purpose is not to get the right answer. 
In some cases there maybe multiple solutions, or they may pose a problem that they expect interviewees are unlikely to completely solve.
Each problem to solve consists of four parts: Concept, Design, Code, Debug
</p>
<ul class='w3-ul'>
	<li><span class='item'>Concept</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The interviewer has you talk about the problem to solve to see if you understand the concept.</li>
	<li><span class='item'>Design</span> You're asked to design (pseudo-code) a solution on paper or whiteboard. They will ask you afterwards for alternative approaches. This is to see your design process.</li>
	<li><span class='item'>Code</span> You will be asked to write it in code, in your preferred language. This is to see your coding skills and whether you write clean or messy code.</li>
	<li><span class='item'>Debug</span> You will be ask at least one problem that most don't get right on the first try, so you will have bugs in it. You will be given some test inputs and ask to walk through your code. 
	This is to see your ability to debug your code and your approach to fixing them.</li>
</ul>

There is a well-recommended book to prepare for this style of interview: Cracking the Code Interview, Gayle Laakmann McDowell
